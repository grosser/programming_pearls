This is my attempt to solve any ruby-solvable problem of programming
pearl in as few, understandable, readable, max 120 character long lines
of ruby (with emphasis on understandable and not 1-line-magic...)


Read it - Print it!

Download as PDF: [output/output.pdf](http://github.com/grosser/programming_pearls/raw/master/output/output.pdf) or as HTML: in [output/output.zip](http://github.com/grosser/programming_pearls/raw/master/output/output.zip), enjoy!


Contribute!
===========
Not all chapters are complete, some problems are unsolved, some code surely can be simplified.


Organisation
============
 - columns go into lib, each column has many tasks -> 1.rb, 2.rb
 - no STDIN since that would complicate running the task


TODO
====
 - there are some chapters missing
 - add cover image (ruby necklace?)
 - syntax highlighting (with js?)
 - add statistics: how does readable code compare to wtf-code
