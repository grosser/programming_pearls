What is it
==========
This is my attempt to solve any ruby-solvable problem of programming
pearl in as few, understandable, readable, max 120 character long lines
of ruby (with emphasis on understandable and not 1-line-magic...)

Organisation
============
Columns go into lib, each column has many tasks -> 1.rb, 2.rb ...  
I am not using STDIN since that would complicate running each task (what file should i use?)
