What is it
==========
This is my attempt to solve any ruby-solvable problem of programming
pearl in as few, understandable, readable, max 120 character long lines
of ruby (with emphasis on understandable and not 1-line-magic...)

Read it!
========
Download this project and look into the `output` dir,
the generated html is printer-friendly!


Organisation
============
 - columns go into lib, each column has many tasks -> 1.rb, 2.rb
 - no STDIN since that would complicate running the task

TODO
====
 - pack output html/css into a single archive -> easy download
 - there are some chapters missing
 - add cover image (ruby necklace?)
 - add introduction
 - syntax highlighting (with js?)
 - add statistics: how does readable code compare to wtf-code
