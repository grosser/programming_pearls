This is my attempt to solve any ruby-solvable problem of programming
pearl in as few, understandable, readable, max 120 character long lines
of ruby (with emphasis on understandable and not 1-line-magic...)

===========
Not all chapters are finished, some code surely can be simplified.

Organisation
============
 - columns go into lib, each column has many tasks -> 1.rb, 2.rb
 - no STDIN since that would complicate running the task

TODO
====
 - there are some chapters missing
 - add cover image (ruby necklace?)
 - syntax highlighting (with js?)
 - add statistics: how does readable code compare to wtf-code
