  <h1>Programming Pearls in Ruby</h1>
  <p>
    This is my rewrite of most of the challenges in the programming-pearls book.
    Ruby allows for a more readable and simple syntax, saving huge ammouts of code
    for any given example (sometime 1 to 10 LOC).
  </p>
  <p>
    Some challenges and discussions are not included since they are pointless for ruby,
    like "how much space needs a hash" or "integers use 8 bit on an 8 bit system and...".
    Most discussions are very condensed, since this should be a quick read.

    The original can be found <a href="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/pearls/">here</a>.
    This version is printer friendly and maybe available as printed copy if i find a cheap way of getting it printed.
